## Introduction and Motivation
To support hands-on learning and deepen intuition in analog circuit design for electrical engineering students and hobbyists, we propose a MOSbius-based Field Programmable Transistor Array (FPTA) architecture that enables reconfiguration and testing of multiple amplifier topologies. By dynamically switching transistor-level connections, users can explore and compare different analog amplifier designs, such as those illustrated in Figure 1.

## Project Datasheet

#### Overview
Figure 2 presents a high level overview of the chip design with its required sub-blocks. In order to be able to construct the desired amplifier circuits, the following blocks are required:

* 2 × NMOS Transistors
* 2 × NMOS Cascode Stage
* 1 × NMOS Differential Pair Stage
* NMOS Current Mirror (1×, 2×, 4×, 8×, 16×)
* 2 × PMOS Transistors
* 2 × PMOS Cascode Stage
* 1 × PMOS Differential Pair Stage
* PMOS Current Mirror (1×, 2×, 4×, 8×, 16×)
* Switch Matrix for Reconfiguration (52 pins × bus-width of 10)
